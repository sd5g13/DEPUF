This directory includes all source data produced by simulating differential emulatable PUF (DEPUF) in SPICE. Each DEPUF is constructed using a 65-nm CMOS technology node.

## Filename definition:
CRPx_y+z.csv indicates the width, the number of booster stages and the number of represser stages as x, y and z, respectively.

File with "crc" indicates the source data produced by DEPUF cascaded with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code as a hash function.
